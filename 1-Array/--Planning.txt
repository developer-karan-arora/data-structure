    0	Reverse the array
    1	Find the maximum and minimum element in an array
    2	Find the "Kth" max and min element of an array
    3	Given an array which consists of only 0, 1 and 2. Sort the array without using any sorting algo
    4	Move all the negative elements to one side of the array
    5	Find the Union and Intersection of the two sorted arrays.
    6	Write a program to cyclically rotate an array by one.
    7	find Largest sum contiguous Subarray [V. IMP]
    8	Minimise the maximum difference between heights [V.IMP]
    9	Minimum no. of Jumps to reach end of an array
    10	find duplicate in an array of N+1 Integers
    11	Merge 2 sorted arrays without using Extra space.
    12	Kadane's Algo [V.V.V.V.V IMP]
    13	Merge Intervals
    14	Next Permutation

    20	Find if there is any subarray with sum equal to 0
    21	Find factorial of a large number
    22	find maximum product subarray
    23	Find longest consecutive subsequence

    32	Minimum swaps required bring elements less equal K together
    33	Minimum no. of operations required to make an array palindrome
    34	Median of 2 sorted arrays of equal size
    35	Median of 2 sorted arrays of different size

Lets use Youtube for watching tutorials
I have to complete the whole as soon as possible
